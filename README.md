## 1. Weighted Average Calculator
The Weighted Average Calculator allows you to input a pre-determined amount of marks, and their corresponding weightings. By doing so, the application will be able to calculate what your current mark is in actuality, rather than estimating by finding the mean. There are two ways to use this feature:
1. Choose a course option (i.e. Math) and the program will prompt you for your mark in each section, which will be shown by name and weighting (i.e. 'KU - 20%'). Upon entering all of the marks, your average will be calculated and presented.
2. Choose other, which will prompt you to enter a mark, followed by its corresponding weighting. Upon entering all of the marks and their weightings, your average will be calculated and presented.

## 2. Final Exam Calculator
The Final Exam Calculator allows you to input your current course mark (at the time of completing the main term), and how much your exam is worth. You will also enter the final mark you would like to complete the course with. Upon entering this information, the program will calculate what mark you must get on your exam to achieve the final mark you desire.
